.SH SYNOPSIS

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
\fIvmod_purge\fP contains functions that offer a finer\-grained control than the
\fBpurge\fP transition in \fBvcl_recv\fP\&. The functions can only be called from
\fBvcl_hit\fP or \fBvcl_miss\fP and they should in general be used in both to
ensure that all variants of a same object are taken care of.
.SH EXAMPLE
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
sub vcl_recv {
    if (req.method == "PURGE") {
        if (client.ip !~ purge_acl) {
            return (synth(405));
        }
        return (hash);
    }
}

sub my_purge {
    set req.http.purged = purge.hard();
    if (req.http.purged == "0") {
        return (synth(404));
    }
    else {
        return (synth(200));
    }
}

sub vcl_hit {
    if (req.method == "PURGE") {
        call my_purge;
    }
}

sub vcl_miss {
    if (req.method == "PURGE") {
        call my_purge;
    }
}

sub vcl_synth {
    if (req.method == "PURGE") {
        if (req.http.purged) {
            set resp.http.purged = req.http.purged;
        }
        return (deliver);
    }

.SS INT hard()
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B Description
This is equivalent to \fBreturn(purge)\fP but explicitly called from
\fBvcl_hit\fP and \fBvcl_miss\fP\&. It returns the number of purged objects.

set req.http.purged = purge.hard();

.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B Description
Sets the TTL, grace and keep. By default, TTL is set to 0 with grace
and keep periods left untouched. Setting a negative value for grace or
keep periods leaves them untouched. Setting all three parameters to
0 is equivalent to a hard purge. It can only be called from \fBvcl_hit\fP
or \fBvcl_miss\fP\&. It returns the number of soft\-purged objects.
