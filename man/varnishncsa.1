varnishncsa [\-a] [\-C] [\-d] [\-D] [\-F format] [\-g <request|vxid>] [\-h] [\-n name] [\-N filename] [\-P file] [\-q query] [\-V] [\-w filename]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
The varnishncsa utility reads varnishd(1) shared memory logs and
presents them in the Apache / NCSA "combined" log format.
.sp
Each log line produced is based on a single Request type transaction
gathered from the shared memory log. The Request transaction is then
scanned for the relevant parts in order to output one log line. To
filter the log lines produced, use the query language to select the
applicable transactions. Non\-request transactions are ignored.
.sp
The following options are available:
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-a
When writing output to a file, append to it rather than overwrite it.
.TP
.B \-C
Do all regular expression and string matching caseless.
.TP
.B \-d
Start processing log records at the head of the log instead of the tail.
.TP
.B \-D
Daemonize.
.TP
.BI \-F \ format
Set the output log format string.
.TP
.BI \-g \ <request|vxid>
The grouping of the log records. The default is to group by vxid.
.TP
.B \-h
Print program usage and exit
.TP
.BI \-n \ name
Specify the name of the varnishd instance to get logs from. If \-n is not specified, the host name is used.
.TP
.BI \-N \ filename
