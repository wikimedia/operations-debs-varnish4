.SH SYNOPSIS
.sp
varnishncsa [\-a] [\-C] [\-d] [\-D] [\-F format] [\-f formatfile] [\-g <request|vxid>] [\-h] [\-n name] [\-N filename] [\-P file] [\-q query] [\-r filename] [\-t <seconds|off>] [\-V] [\-w filename]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
The varnishncsa utility reads varnishd(1) shared memory logs and
presents them in the Apache / NCSA "combined" log format.
.sp
Each log line produced is based on a single Request type transaction
gathered from the shared memory log. The Request transaction is then
scanned for the relevant parts in order to output one log line. To
filter the log lines produced, use the query language to select the
applicable transactions. Non\-request transactions are ignored.
.sp
The following options are available:
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-a
When writing output to a file, append to it rather than overwrite it.
.TP
.B \-C
Do all regular expression and string matching caseless.
.TP
.B \-d
Start processing log records at the head of the log instead of the tail.
.TP
.B \-D
Daemonize.
.TP
.BI \-F \ format
Set the output log format string.
.TP
.BI \-f \ formatfile
Read output format from a file. Will read a single line from the specified file, and use that line as the format.
.TP
.BI \-g \ <request|vxid>
The grouping of the log records. The default is to group by vxid.
.TP
.B \-h
Print program usage and exit
.TP
.BI \-n \ name
Specify the name of the varnishd instance to get logs from. If \-n is not specified, the host name is used.
.TP
.BI \-N \ filename
Specify the filename of a stale VSM instance. When using this option the abandonment checking is disabled.
.TP
.BI \-P \ file
Write the process\(aq PID to the specified file.
.TP
.BI \-q \ query
Specifies the VSL query to use.
.TP
.BI \-r \ filename
Read log in binary file format from this file. The file can be created with \fBvarnishlog \-w filename\fP.
.TP
.BI \-t \ <seconds|off>
Timeout before returning error on initial VSM connection. If set the VSM connection is retried every 0.5 seconds for this many seconds. If zero the connection is attempted only once and will fail immediately if unsuccessful. If set to "off", the connection will not fail, allowing the utility to start and wait indefinetely for the Varnish instance to appear.  Defaults to 5 seconds.
.TP
.B \-V
Print version information and exit.
.TP
.BI \-w \ filename
Redirect output to file. The file will be overwritten unless the \-a option was specified. If the application receives a SIGHUP in daemon mode the file will be reopened allowing the old one to be rotated away. This option is required when running in daemon mode.
.UNINDENT
.SH FORMAT
.sp
Specify the log format used. If no format is specified the default log
format is used.
.sp
The default log format is:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
%h %l %u %t "%r" %s %b "%{Referer}i" "%{User\-agent}i"
.ft P
.fi
.sp
Escape sequences \en and \et are supported.
.sp
Supported formatters are:
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B %b
Size of response in bytes, excluding HTTP headers.  In CLF format,
i.e. a \(aq\-\(aq rather than a 0 when no bytes are sent.
.TP
.B %D
Time taken to serve the request, in microseconds.
.TP
.B %H
The request protocol. Defaults to HTTP/1.0 if not known.
.TP
.B %h
Remote host. Defaults to \(aq\-\(aq if not known.
.TP
.B %I
Total bytes received from client.
.TP
.B %{X}i
The contents of request header X.
.TP
.B %l
Remote logname (always \(aq\-\(aq)
.TP
.B %m
Request method. Defaults to \(aq\-\(aq if not known.
.TP
.B %{X}o
The contents of response header X.
.TP
.B %O
Total bytes sent to client.
.TP
.B %q
The query string, if no query string exists, an empty string.
.TP
.B %r
The first line of the request. Synthesized from other fields, so it
may not be the request verbatim.
.TP
.B %s
Status sent to the client
.TP
.B %t
Time when the request was received, in HTTP date/time format.
.TP
.B %{X}t
Time when the request was received, in the format specified
by X. The time specification format is the same as for strftime(3).
.TP
.B %T
Time taken to serve the request, in seconds.
.TP
.B %U
The request URL without any query string. Defaults to \(aq\-\(aq if not
known.
.TP
.B %u
Remote user from auth
.TP
.B %{X}x
Extended variables.  Supported variables are:
.INDENT 7.0
.TP
.B Varnish:time_firstbyte
Time from when the request processing starts until the first byte
is sent to the client.
.TP
.B Varnish:hitmiss
Whether the request was a cache hit or miss. Pipe and pass are
considered misses.
.TP
.B Varnish:handling
How the request was handled, whether it was a cache hit, miss,
pass, pipe or synth.
.TP
.B VCL_Log:key
Output value set by std.log("key:value") in VCL.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.SH SIGNALS
.INDENT 0.0
