.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
Varnish has a command line interface (CLI) which can control and change
most of the operational parameters and the configuration of Varnish,
without interrupting the running service.
.sp
The CLI can be used for the following tasks:
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B configuration
You can upload, change and delete VCL files from the CLI.
.TP
.B parameters
You can inspect and change the various parameters Varnish has
available through the CLI. The individual parameters are
documented in the varnishd(1) man page.
.TP
.B bans
Bans are filters that are applied to keep Varnish from serving
stale content. When you issue a ban Varnish will not serve any
\fIbanned\fP object from cache, but rather re\-fetch it from its
backend servers.
.TP
.B process management
You can stop and start the cache (child) process though the
CLI. You can also retrieve the latest stack trace if the child
process has crashed.
.UNINDENT
.sp
If you invoke varnishd(1) with \-T, \-M or \-d the CLI will be
available. In debug mode (\-d) the CLI will be in the foreground, with
\-T you can connect to it with varnishadm or telnet and with \-M
varnishd will connect back to a listening service \fIpushing\fP the CLI to
that service. Please see \fIvarnishd(1)\fP for details.
.SS Syntax
.sp
The Varnish CLI is similar to another command line interface, the Bourne
Shell. Commands are usually terminated with a newline, and they may take
arguments. The command and its arguments are \fItokenized\fP before parsing,
and as such arguments containing must must be enclosed in double quotes.
.sp
It means that command parsing of
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
help banner
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
is equivalent to
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
"help" banner
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
because the double quotes only indicate the boundaries of the \fBhelp\fP
token.
.sp
Within double quotes you can escape characters with \e (backslash). The \en,
\er, and \et get translated to newlines, carriage returns, an tabs.  Double
quotes and backslashes themselves can be escaped with \e" and \e\e
respectively.
.sp
To enter characters in octals use the \ennn syntax. Hexadecimals can
be entered with the \exnn syntax.
.sp
Commands may not end with a newline when a shell\-style \fIhere document\fP
(here\-document or heredoc) is used. The format of a here document is:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
<< word
     here document
word
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fIword\fP can be any continuous string chosen to make sure it doesn\(aqt appear
naturally in the following \fIhere document\fP\&. Traditionally EOF or END is
used.
.sp
When using the here document style of input there are no restrictions
on length. When using newline\-terminated commands maximum length is
limited by the varnishd parameter \fIcli_buffer\fP\&.
.SS Quoting pitfalls
.sp
Integrating with the Varnish CLI can be sometimes surprising when quoting
is involved. For instance in Bourne Shell the delimiter used with here
documents may or may not be separated by spaces from the \fB<<\fP token:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
cat <<EOF
hello
world
EOF
hello
world
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
With the Varnish CLI, the \fB<<\fP and \fBEOF\fP tokens must be separated by
at least one blank:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
vcl.inline boot <<EOF
106 258
Message from VCC\-compiler:
VCL version declaration missing
Update your VCL to Version 4 syntax, and add
        vcl 4.0;
on the first line of the VCL files.
(\(aq<vcl.inline>\(aq Line 1 Pos 1)
<<EOF
##\-\-\-

Running VCC\-compiler failed, exited with 2
VCL compilation failed
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
With the missing space, the here document can be added and the actual VCL
can be loaded:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
vcl.inline test << EOF
vcl 4.0;

backend be {
        .host = "localhost";
}
EOF
200 14
VCL compiled.
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
When using a front\-end to the Varnish\-CLI like \fBvarnishadm\fP, one must
take into account the double expansion happening.  First in the shell
launching the \fBvarnishadm\fP command and then in the Varnish CLI itself.
When a command\(aqs parameter require spaces, you need to ensure that the
Varnish CLI will see the double quotes:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
varnishadm param.set cc_command \(aq"my alternate cc command"\(aq

Change will take effect when VCL script is reloaded
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Otherwise if you don\(aqt quote the quotes, you may get a seemingly unrelated
error message:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
varnishadm param.set cc_command "my alternate cc command"
Unknown request.
Type \(aqhelp\(aq for more info.
Too many parameters

Command failed with error code 105
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
If you are quoting with a here document, you must wrap it inside a shell
multi\-line argument:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
varnishadm vcl.inline test \(aq<< EOF
vcl 4.0;

backend be {
        .host = "localhost";
}
EOF\(aq
VCL compiled.
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Other pitfalls include variable expansion of the shell invoking \fBvarnishadm\fP
but this is not directly related to the Varnish CLI. If you get the quoting
right you should be fine even with complex commands.

.SS Backend Expression
.sp
A backend expression can be a backend name or a combination of backend
name, IP address and port in "name(IP address:port)" format. All fields
are optional. If no exact matching backend is found, partial matching
will be attempted based on the provided name, IP address and port fields.
.sp
Examples:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
backend.list def*
backend.set_health default sick
backend.set_health def* healthy
backend.set_health * auto
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.SS Ban Expressions
.sp
A ban expression consists of one or more conditions.  A condition
consists of a field, an operator, and an argument.  Conditions can be
ANDed together with "&&".
.sp
A field can be any of the variables from VCL, for instance req.url,
req.http.host or obj.http.set\-cookie.
.sp
Operators are "==" for direct comparison, "~" for a regular
expression match, and ">" or "<" for size comparisons.  Prepending
an operator with "!" negates the expression.
.sp
The argument could be a quoted string, a regexp, or an integer.
Integers can have "KB", "MB", "GB" or "TB" appended for size related
fields.
.SS VCL Temperature
.sp
A VCL program goes through several states related to the different commands: it
can be loaded, used, and later discarded. You can load several VCL programs and
switch at any time from one to another. There is only one active VCL, but the
previous active VCL will be maintained active until all its transactions are
over.
.sp
Over time, if you often refresh your VCL and keep the previous versions around,
resource consumption will increase, you can\(aqt escape that. However, most of the
time you want only one to pay the price only for the active VCL and keep older
VCLs in case you\(aqd need to rollback to a previous version.
.sp
The VCL temperature allows you to minimize the footprint of inactive VCLs. Once
a VCL becomes cold, Varnish will release all the resources that can be be later
reacquired. You can manually set the temperature of a VCL or let varnish
automatically handle it.
.SS Scripting
.sp
If you are going to write a script that talks CLI to varnishd, the
include/cli.h contains the relevant magic numbers.
.sp
One particular magic number to know, is that the line with the status
code and length field always is exactly 13 characters long, including
the NL character.
.sp
For your reference the sourcefile lib/libvarnish/cli_common.h contains
the functions Varnish code uses to read and write CLI response.
.SS How \-S/PSK Authentication Works
.sp
If the \-S secret\-file is given as argument to varnishd, all network
CLI connections must authenticate, by proving they know the contents
of that file.
.sp
The file is read at the time the auth command is issued and the
contents is not cached in varnishd, so it is possible to update the
file on the fly.
.sp
Use the unix file permissions to control access to the file.
.sp
An authenticated session looks like this:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
critter phk> telnet localhost 1234
Trying ::1...
Trying 127.0.0.1...
Connected to localhost.
Escape character is \(aq^]\(aq.

.sp
The CLI status of 107 indicates that authentication is necessary. The
first 32 characters of the response text is the challenge
"ixsl...mpg". The challenge is randomly generated for each CLI
connection, and changes each time a 107 is emitted.
.sp
The most recently emitted challenge must be used for calculating the
authenticator "455c...c89a".
.sp
The authenticator is calculated by applying the SHA256 function to the
following byte sequence:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
Challenge string
.IP \(bu 2
Newline (0x0a) character.
.IP \(bu 2
Contents of the secret file
.IP \(bu 2
Challenge string
.IP \(bu 2
Newline (0x0a) character.

and dumping the resulting digest in lower\-case hex.

The sourcefile lib/libvarnish/cli_auth.c contains a useful function
which calculates the response, given an open filedescriptor to the
secret file, and the challenge string.
