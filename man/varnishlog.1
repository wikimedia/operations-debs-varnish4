.SH OPTIONS
.sp
The following options are available:
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-a
When writing output to a file, append to it rather than overwrite it.
.TP
.B \-b
Only display transactions and log records coming from backend communication.
.TP
.B \-B
Output binary data suitable for reading with \-r.
.TP
.B \-c
Only display transactions and log records coming from client communication.
.TP
.B \-C
Do all regular expression and string matching caseless.
.TP
.B \-d
Start processing log records at the head of the log instead of the tail.
.TP
.B \-D
Daemonize.
.TP
.BI \-g \ <session|request|vxid|raw>
The grouping of the log records. The default is to group by vxid.
.TP
.B \-h
Print program usage and exit
.TP
.BI \-i \ taglist
Include log records of these tags in output. Taglist is a comma\-separated list of tag globs. Multiple \-i options may be given.
.sp
If a tag include option is the first of any tag selection options, all tags are first marked excluded.
.TP
.BI \-I \ <[taglist:]regex>
Include by regex matching. Output only records matching taglist and regular expression. Applies to any tag if taglist is absent.
.sp
If a tag include option is the first of any tag selection options, all tags are first marked excluded.
.TP
.BI \-k \ num
Process this number of matching log transactions before exiting.
.TP
.BI \-L \ limit
Sets the upper limit of incomplete transactions kept before the oldest transaction is force completed. A warning record is synthesized when this happens. This setting keeps an upper bound on the memory usage of running queries. Defaults to 1000 transactions.
.TP
.BI \-n \ name
Specify the name of the varnishd instance to get logs from. If \-n is not specified, the host name is used.
.TP
.BI \-N \ filename
Specify the filename of a stale VSM instance. When using this option the abandonment checking is disabled.
.TP
.BI \-P \ file
Write the process\(aq PID to the specified file.
.TP
.BI \-q \ query
Specifies the VSL query to use.
.TP
.BI \-r \ filename
Read log in binary file format from this file.
.TP
.BI \-T \ seconds
Sets the transaction timeout in seconds. This defines the maximum number of seconds elapsed between a Begin tag and the End tag. If the timeout expires, a warning record is synthesized and the transaction is force completed. Defaults to 120 seconds.
.TP
.B \-v
Use verbose output on record set printing, giving the VXID on every log line. Without this option, the VXID will only be given on the header of that transaction.
.TP
.B \-V
Print version information and exit.
.TP
.BI \-w \ filename
Redirect output to file. The file will be overwritten unless the \-a option was specified. If the application receives a SIGHUP the file will be reopened allowing the old one to be rotated away.
.TP
.BI \-x \ taglist
Exclude log records of these tags in output. Taglist is a comma\-separated list of tag globs. Multiple \-x options may be given.
.TP
.BI \-X \ <[taglist:]regex>
Exclude by regex matching. Do not output records matching taglist and regular expression. Applies to any tag if taglist is absent.
