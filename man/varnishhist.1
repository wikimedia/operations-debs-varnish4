.SH SYNOPSIS
.sp
varnishhist [\-C] [\-d] [\-g <request|vxid>] [\-h] [\-L limit] [\-n name] [\-N filename] [\-p period] [\-P <size|responsetime|tag:field_num:min:max>] [\-q query] [\-r filename] [\-t <seconds|off>] [\-T seconds] [\-V]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
The varnishhist utility reads varnishd(1) shared memory logs and
presents a continuously updated histogram showing the distribution
of the last N requests by their processing.  The value of N and the
vertical scale are displayed in the top left corner.  The horizontal
scale is logarithmic.  Hits are marked with a pipe character ("|"),
and misses are marked with a hash character ("#").
.sp
The following options are available:
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-C
Do all regular expression and string matching caseless.
.TP
.B \-d
Process log records at the head of the log and exit.
.TP
.BI \-g \ <request|vxid>
The grouping of the log records. The default is to group by vxid.
.TP
.B \-h
Print program usage and exit
.TP
.BI \-L \ limit
Sets the upper limit of incomplete transactions kept before the oldest transaction is force completed. A warning record is synthesized when this happens. This setting keeps an upper bound on the memory usage of running queries. Defaults to 1000 transactions.
.TP
.BI \-n \ name
Specify the name of the varnishd instance to get logs from. If \-n is not specified, the host name is used.
.TP
.BI \-N \ filename
Specify the filename of a stale VSM instance. When using this option the abandonment checking is disabled.
.TP
.BI \-p \ period
Specified the number of seconds between screen refreshes. Default is 1 second, and can be changed at runtime by pressing the [1\-9] keys.
.TP
.BI \-P \ <size|responsetime|tag:field_num:min:max>
Either specify "size" or "responsetime" profile or create a new one. Define the tag we\(aqll look for, and the field number of the value we are interested in. min and max are the boundaries of the graph (these are power of tens).
.TP
.BI \-q \ query
Specifies the VSL query to use.
.TP
.BI \-r \ filename
Read log in binary file format from this file. The file can be created with \fBvarnishlog \-w filename\fP\&.
.TP
.BI \-t \ <seconds|off>
Timeout before returning error on initial VSM connection. If set the VSM connection is retried every 0.5 seconds for this many seconds. If zero the connection is attempted only once and will fail immediately if unsuccessful. If set to "off", the connection will not fail, allowing the utility to start and wait indefinetely for the Varnish instance to appear.  Defaults to 5 seconds.
.TP
.BI \-T \ seconds
Sets the transaction timeout in seconds. This defines the maximum number of seconds elapsed between a Begin tag and the End tag. If the timeout expires, a warning record is synthesized and the transaction is force completed. Defaults to 120 seconds.
.TP
.B \-V
Print version information and exit.
