.. _vcl_variables:

VCL Variables
-------------

Variables provide read, write and delete access to almost all aspects
of the work at hand.

Reading a variable is done simply by using its name in VCL::

    if (client.ip ~ bad_guys) {
	return (synth(400));
    }

Writing a variable, where this is possible, is done with a `set`
statement::

    set resp.http.never = "Let You Down";

Similarly, deleting a variable, for the few variables where this is
possible, is done with a `unset` statement::

    unset req.http.cookie;

Which operations are possible on each variable is described below,
often with the shorthand "backend" which covers the `vcl_backend_*`
methods and "client" which covers the rest, except `vcl_init` and
`vcl_fini`.

When setting a variable, the right hand side of the equal sign
must have the variables type, you cannot assign a STRING to
a variable of type NUMBER, even if the string is `"42"`.
(Explicit conversion functions can be found in
:ref:`vmod_std(3)`).

local, server, remote and client
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

These variables describe the network connection between the
client and varnishd.

Without PROXY protocol::

	     client    server
	     remote    local
	       v          v
	CLIENT ------------ VARNISHD


With PROXY protocol::

	     client    server   remote     local
	       v          v       v          v
	CLIENT ------------ PROXY ------------ VARNISHD

	Type: IP

	Readable from: client, backend

	The IP address (and port number) of the local end of the
	TCP connection, for instance `192.168.1.1:81`

	If the connection is a UNIX domain socket, the value
	will be `0.0.0.0:0`

local.endpoint	``VCL >= 4.1``

	Type: STRING

	Readable from: client, backend

	The address of the '-a' socket the session was accepted on.

	If the argument was `-a foo=:81` this would be ":81"

	Type: STRING

	Readable from: client, backend

	The name of the '-a' socket the session was accepted on.

	If the argument was `-a foo=:81` this would be "foo".

	Note that all '-a' gets a default name on the form `a%d`
	if no name is provided.

remote.ip

	Type: IP

	Readable from: client, backend

	The IP address of the other end of the TCP connection.
	This can either be the clients IP, or the outgoing IP
	of a proxy server.

	If the connection is a UNIX domain socket, the value
	will be `0.0.0.0:0`

client.ip

	Type: IP

	Readable from: client, backend


	The client's IP address, either the same as `local.ip`
	or what the PROXY protocol told us.

client.identity

	Type: STRING

	Readable from: client

	Writable from: client


	Identification of the client, used to load balance
	in the client director.  Defaults to `client.ip`

	This variable can be overwritten with more precise
	information, for instance extracted from a `Cookie:`
	header.


server.ip

	Type: IP

	Readable from: client, backend


	The IP address of the socket on which the client
	connection was received, either the same as `server.ip`
	or what the PROXY protocol told us.

	If an `-i` parameter is not passed to varnishd, the return
	value from `gethostname(3)` system function will be used.

HTTP/2 connection.

	stevedore.


storage.<name>.happy

	Type: BOOL

	Readable from: client, backend


	Health status for the named stevedore. Not available in any of the
	current stevedores.

HTTP response status
--------------------

A status code normally has 3 digits XYZ where X must be between 1 and 5
included. Since it is not uncommon to see HTTP clients or servers relying
on non-standard or even invalid status codes Varnish tolerates any status
between 100 and 999.

With VCL code it is possible to use status codes in the form XXYZZ where the
overall value is lower than 65536 and the Y digit is between 1 and 9 included.
Only the YZZ part is sent to the client.

The XXYZZ form of status codes can be set on ``resp.status`` and
``beresp.status`` or passed via ``return(synth(...))`` and
``return(error(...))`` transitions.

XX can be therefore be used to pass information around inside VCL, for
instance ``return(synth(22404))`` from ``vcl_recv{}`` to ``vcl_synth{}``.

The ``obj.status`` variable will inherit the XXYZZ form, but in a ban
expresion only the YZZ part will be available. The XXYZZ form is strictly
limited to VCL execution.

Assigning an HTTP standardized code to ``resp.status`` or ``beresp.status``
will also set ``resp.reason`` or ``beresp.reason``  to the corresponding
status message.
