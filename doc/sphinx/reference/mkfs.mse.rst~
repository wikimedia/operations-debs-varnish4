:Manual section: 1

SYNOPSIS
========

mkfs.mse [-c <in.conf>] [-f]

DESCRIPTION
===========

The `mkfs.mse` utility creates and initializes the data files and stores
for use with Massive Storage Engine. It reads the same configuration file
as would be pointed to when directing `varnishd` to use MSE for object
storage, and this utility needs to be run once before starting `varnishd`
with MSE for the first time.

If a previous configuration exists and is initialized in the data files
and stores, `mkfs.mse` will give an error instead of overwriting the
existing data. If overwrite and clear of the data files is wanted, use the
`-f` force flag to override the error. This will clear the cache
completely, having an empty cache when `varnishd` is then started.

OPTIONS
=======

-c <in.conf>

  The configuration file to use. See `man mse-config` for details of the
  configuration file.

-f

  Use the force option. This overrides the error of previous existing
  configuration.
