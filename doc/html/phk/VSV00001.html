<p>As embarrased as I am to find out that after 35 years of writing
C-programs I <em>still</em> dont understand signed/unsigned variables, I
am also incredibly proud that it took eleven years before Varnish
had a major security incident.</p>
<p>One side-effect of this episode is that the ink is still wet on
most of the policies for handling security issues in the Varnish
Project.</p>
<p>We are, in the inimitable words of Amanda F. Palmer,
<em>“guilty of making shit up as you go along.”</em></p>
<p>So here is what we made up:</p>
<div class="section" id="vwv-vulnerability-workaround-in-vcl">
<h2>VWV - Vulnerability Workaround in VCL<a class="headerlink" href="#vwv-vulnerability-workaround-in-vcl" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Rolling a new Varnish release, even with an trivial one-line patch
is not a fast operation, getting from patch to packages rolled and
pushed into operating system respositories takes at least several
days, provided you can get everybodys attention.</p>
<p>Being able to offer users a way to mitigate security issues in VCL
bypasses all that red tape:  The moment you have the advisory in
hand, you can defend your Varnish instance.</p>
<p>VCL mitigation will always be our priority number one.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="wlic-we-love-inline-c">
<h2>WLIC - We Love Inline C<a class="headerlink" href="#wlic-we-love-inline-c" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Brian W. Kernighan famously said that <a class="reference external" href="https://www.lysator.liu.se/c/bwk-on-pascal.html">he didn’t like the
programming language PASCAL</a>
because <em>“There is no escape.”</em></p>
<p>That quote is why Varnish got inline-C code from day one, to make sure
there would always be an escape.</p>
<p>However, recently we have been wondering if we should discontinue
inline-C code, now that we have the much nicer and more structured
VMOD facility.</p>
<p>Well, that’s all settled now:  Inline-C stays, because it enabled us
to craft the VCL-snippets to mitigate this “deep-code” security issue.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="vsv-varnish-security-vulnerability">
<h2>VSV - Varnish Security Vulnerability<a class="headerlink" href="#vsv-varnish-security-vulnerability" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>To my utter surprise, I could not get an embargoed CVE number,
without having to reveal what was going on.</p>
<p>There are good and sane reasons for that, and I harbour no
ill feelings against the people who refused.  Their policies
need to target the really buggy software, and history has
shown that to be anything but easy.</p>
<p>But being unable to get a CVE number when we needed one, left us
without a handle, and there being no signs that this was a fluke,
we decided to start our own numbering of Varnish Security
Vulnerabilities.</p>
<p>We are starting from VSV number 1, as this one is the first real
flag day for us, and we have reserved VTC testnames <cite>f%05d</cite> to
go with it.</p>
<p>Five digits should be enough for everybody.</p>
<p>As soon as possible, if possible, we will of course try to get a
unique CVE number attached to each VSV, but the VSV will be
our own primary handle.</p>

<div class="section" id="vivu-very-important-varnish-users">
<h2>VIVU - Very Important Varnish Users<a class="headerlink" href="#vivu-very-important-varnish-users" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>I have been struggling with this problem for a long time, because
sooner or later we would hit this event.</p>
<p>Clearly some people deserve to get an early heads-up on
security advisories, but who ?</p>
<p>Any list big enough to be fair would also be too easy to sneak into
for people who should not be on it.</p>
<p>Such a list would also be a major head-ache for us to maintain, not
to mention setting and judging the qualification criteria, and
dealing with appeals from the ones we rejected.</p>
<p>Instead I have decided that we are simply going to follow the money.</p>
<p>People and companies who paid at least €1000 for a <a class="reference external" href="http://phk.freebsd.dk/VML/">Varnish Moral
License</a> in the 12 months before the
publication date, get advance warning of our security advisories.</p>
<p>Those €1000 per year goes almost <a class="footnote-reference" href="#f1" id="id1">[1]</a> 100% to maintain, develop and
improve Varnish, so even if there are no security advisories, the
money will be well spent beneficially for a Varnish user.</p>
<p>Of course nothing prevents Wile E. Hacker from also paying €1000
every year to receive advance notice, but I suspect it would sting
a bit to know that your own money is being used to prevent the event
you are gambling on - and that it might take eleven years for the
ball to stop.</p>
<p>But we will <em>also</em> maintain a VIVU-list, for people and companies
who contribute materially to the Varnish Project in some way,
(documentation, code, machines, testing, meeting-rooms…) or
people we judge should be there for some other good reason.</p>
<p>If you feel you should be on the VIVU list, drop me an email,
don’t forget to include your PGP key.</p>

<div class="section" id="vqs-varnish-quality-software">
<h2>VQS - Varnish Quality Software<a class="headerlink" href="#vqs-varnish-quality-software" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>From the very first line of code, Varnish has also been a software
quality experiment, I wanted to show the world that software
does not have to suck.</p>
<p>Strange as it sounds, now that we finally had a major security
issue, I feel kind of vindicated, in a strange kind of <em>“The house
burned down but I’m happy to know that the fire-alarm did work”</em>
kind of way.</p>
<p>We have had some CVE’s before, but none of them were major issues.</p>
<p>The closest was probably
<a class="reference external" href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2013-4484">CVE-2013-4484</a>
four years ago, which in many ways was like VSV00001, but it only affected users
with a not so common VCL construct.</p>
<p>VSV00001 on the other hand exposes all contemporary Varnishes,
it doesn’t get any more major than that.</p>
<p>But it took eleven years <a class="footnote-reference" href="#f2" id="id2">[2]</a> to get to that point, primarily
because Varnish is a software quality experiment.</p>
<p>How unusual our level of software quality is, was brought home by
the response to my request for a CVE number under embargo:
<em>“I can do an embargoed CVE, but I’m not comfortable assigning one
blindly to someone who doesn’t have a history of requesting them.”</em>
- that sounds like praise by faint damnation to me.</p>
<p>Anyway, I will not promise that we will have no major security
issues until the year 2028, but I’ll do my damnest to make it so.</p>

<h2>VDR - Varnish Developers Rock<a class="headerlink" href="#vdr-varnish-developers-rock" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>When this issue surfaced I had contractors and moving boxes all
around me and barely had workable internet connectivity in the new
house.</p>
<p>The usual gang of Varnish developers did a smashing job, largely on
their own, and I am incredibly thankful for that.</p>
<p>Much appreciated guys!</p>
<p>And also a big round of thanks to the sponsors and VML contributors
who have had patience with me trying to do the right thing, even
if it took a while longer:  I hope you agree that it has been
worth it.</p>
