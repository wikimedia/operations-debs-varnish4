$Module proxy 3 "Varnish Module to extract TLV attributes from PROXYv2"
$ABI strict

DESCRIPTION
===========

`vmod_proxy` contains functions to extract proxy-protocol-v2 TLV attributes
as described in https://www.haproxy.org/download/1.8/doc/proxy-protocol.txt.


$Function STRING alpn()

Description
	Extract ALPN attribute.
Example
	set req.http.alpn = proxy.alpn();

$Function STRING authority()

Description
	Extract authority attribute. This corresponds to SNI from a TLS
	connection.
Example
	set req.http.authority = proxy.authority();

$Function BOOL is_ssl()

Description
	Report if proxy-protocol-v2 has SSL TLV.

Example
	| if (proxy.is_ssl()) {
	|     set req.http.ssl-version = proxy.ssl_version();
	| }

$Function BOOL client_has_cert_sess()

Description
	Report if the client provided a certificate at least once over the TLS
	session this connection belongs to.

$Function BOOL client_has_cert_conn()

Description
	Report if the client provided a certificate over the current connection.

$Function INT ssl_verify_result()

Description
	Report the SSL_get_verify_result from a TLS session. It only matters
	if client_has_cert_sess() is true. Per default, value is set to 0
	(X509_V_OK).

Example
	| if (proxy.client_has_cert_sess() && proxy.ssl_verify_result() == 0) {
	|     set req.http.ssl-verify = "ok";
	| }

$Function STRING ssl_version()

Description
	Extract SSL version attribute.
Example
	set req.http.ssl-version = proxy.ssl_version();

$Function STRING client_cert_cn()

Description
	Extract the common name attribute of the client certificate's.
Example
	set req.http.cert-cn = proxy.client_cert_cn();

$Function STRING ssl_cipher()

Description
	Extract the SSL cipher attribute.
Example
	set req.http.ssl-cipher = proxy.ssl_cipher();

$Function STRING cert_sign()

Description
	Extract the certificate signature algorithm attribute.
Example
	set req.http.cert-sign = proxy.cert_sign();

$Function STRING cert_key()

Description
	Extract the certificate key algorithm attribute.
Example
	set req.http.cert-key = proxy.cert_key();
