Subject: [PATCH] Avoid buffer read overflow on vcl_error and -sfile

The file stevedore may return a buffer larger than asked for when
requesting storage. Due to lack of check for this condition, the code
to copy the synthetic error memory buffer from vcl_error would overrun
the buffer.

Fixes: #2429
