The WMF varnish4 packaging project on gerrit has 3 branches:

- master
- upstream
- debian-wmf

https://gerrit.wikimedia.org/r/#/admin/projects/operations/debs/varnish4,branches

master and upstream follow the respective branches on
https://anonscm.debian.org/cgit/pkg-varnish/pkg-varnish.git/

master is where debian packaging happens, upstream is the upstream source code.

Finally, debian-wmf is our branch with local WMF modifications (such as this
file).
